In this repo, all about Data preprocessing. Data preprocessing is a required first step before any machine learning machinery can be applied, because the algorithms learn from the data and the learning outcome for problem solving heavily depends on the proper data needed to solve a particular problem â€“ which are called features. Examples of data preprocessing include cleaning, instance selection, normalization, one hot encoding, transformation, feature extraction and selection, etc.
