In this repo, all about Data preprocessing. Data preprocessing is a required first step before any machine learning machinery can be applied, because the algorithms learn from the data and the learning outcome for problem solving heavily depends on the proper data needed to solve a particular problem â€“ which are called features. Examples of data preprocessing include cleaning, instance selection, normalization, one hot encoding, transformation, feature extraction and selection, etc.

Topics that are covered:
1. Introduction of Data Preprocessing
2. Introduction of Feature Engineering
3. Types of Data Variables
4. Handling of Missing Values with Different Methods
5. One Hot Encoding and Dummy Variable
6. Label Encoder and Ordinal Encoder
7. Split the Data into Train and Test
7. Feature Scaling with Standardization and MinMax Methods
8. Feature Selection with different Methods
